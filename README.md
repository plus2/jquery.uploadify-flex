What is it?
===========
The flash/jQuery multiple file uploader at http://www.uploadify.com/ is quite nice, but has a few bugs and slow development progress.

The flash part's "source" is contained in a .fla file. This is only openable by the Flash IDE, an expensive program I have no need for.

So I extracted the ActionScript and ported it to work with the free Flex SDK.

To compile
==========

- Get Flex SDK at http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+3
- unzip it somewhere and set FLEX_HOME to its path
- run `rake`
